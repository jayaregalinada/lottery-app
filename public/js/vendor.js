 * @ngdoc module
 * @name ngAnimate
 * @description
 *
 * The `ngAnimate` module provides support for JavaScript, CSS3 transition and CSS3 keyframe animation hooks within existing core and custom directives.
 *
 * <div doc-module-components="ngAnimate"></div>
 *
 * # Usage
 *
 * To see animations in action, all that is required is to define the appropriate CSS classes
 * or to register a JavaScript animation via the `myModule.animation()` function. The directives that support animation automatically are:
 * `ngRepeat`, `ngInclude`, `ngIf`, `ngSwitch`, `ngShow`, `ngHide`, `ngView` and `ngClass`. Custom directives can take advantage of animation
 * by using the `$animate` service.
 *
 * Below is a more detailed breakdown of the supported animation events provided by pre-existing ng directives:
 *
 * | Directive                                                                                                | Supported Animations                                                     |
 * |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat#animations ngRepeat}                                                        | enter, leave and move                                                    |
 * | {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView#animations ngView}                                                       | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngInclude#animations ngInclude}                                                      | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngSwitch#animations ngSwitch}                                                        | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngIf#animations ngIf}                                                                | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngClass#animations ngClass}                                                          | add and remove (the CSS class(es) present)                               |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngShow#animations ngShow} & {@link ng.directive:ngHide#animations ngHide}            | add and remove (the ng-hide class value)                                 |
 * | {@link ng.directive:form#animation-hooks form} & {@link ng.directive:ngModel#animation-hooks ngModel}    | add and remove (dirty, pristine, valid, invalid & all other validations) |
 * | {@link module:ngMessages#animations ngMessages}                                                          | add and remove (ng-active & ng-inactive)                                 |
 * | {@link module:ngMessages#animations ngMessage}                                                           | enter and leave                                                          |
 *
 * You can find out more information about animations upon visiting each directive page.
 *
 * Below is an example of how to apply animations to a directive that supports animation hooks:
 *
 * ```html
 * <style type="text/css">
 * .slide.ng-enter, .slide.ng-leave {
 *   -webkit-transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 * }
 *
 * .slide.ng-enter { }        /&#42; starting animations for enter &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-enter.ng-enter-active { } /&#42; terminal animations for enter &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-leave { }        /&#42; starting animations for leave &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-leave.ng-leave-active { } /&#42; terminal animations for leave &#42;/
 * </style>
 *
 * <!--
 * the animate service will automatically add .ng-enter and .ng-leave to the element
 * to trigger the CSS transition/animations
 * -->
 * <ANY class="slide" ng-include="..."></ANY>
 * ```
 *
 * Keep in mind that, by default, if an animation is running, any child elements cannot be animated
 * until the parent element's animation has completed. This blocking feature can be overridden by
 * placing the `ng-animate-children` attribute on a parent container tag.
 *
 * ```html
 * <div class="slide-animation" ng-if="on" ng-animate-children>
 *   <div class="fade-animation" ng-if="on">
 *     <div class="explode-animation" ng-if="on">
 *        ...
 *     </div>
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * When the `on` expression value changes and an animation is triggered then each of the elements within
 * will all animate without the block being applied to child elements.
 *
 * ## Are animations run when the application starts?
 * No they are not. When an application is bootstrapped Angular will disable animations from running to avoid
 * a frenzy of animations from being triggered as soon as the browser has rendered the screen. For this to work,
 * Angular will wait for two digest cycles until enabling animations. From there on, any animation-triggering
 * layout changes in the application will trigger animations as normal.
 *
 * In addition, upon bootstrap, if the routing system or any directives or load remote data (via $http) then Angular
 * will automatically extend the wait time to enable animations once **all** of the outbound HTTP requests
 * are complete.
 *
 * ## CSS-defined Animations
 * The animate service will automatically apply two CSS classes to the animated element and these two CSS classes
 * are designed to contain the start and end CSS styling. Both CSS transitions and keyframe animations are supported
 * and can be used to play along with this naming structure.
 *
 * The following code below demonstrates how to perform animations using **CSS transitions** with Angular:
 *
 * ```html
 * <style type="text/css">
 * /&#42;
 *  The animate class is apart of the element and the ng-enter class
 *  is attached to the element once the enter animation event is triggered
 * &#42;/
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter {
 *  -webkit-transition: 1s linear all; /&#42; Safari/Chrome &#42;/
 *  transition: 1s linear all; /&#42; All other modern browsers and IE10+ &#42;/
 *
 *  /&#42; The animation preparation code &#42;/
 *  opacity: 0;
 * }
 *
 * /&#42;
 *  Keep in mind that you want to combine both CSS
 *  classes together to avoid any CSS-specificity
 *  conflicts
 * &#42;/
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *  /&#42; The animation code itself &#42;/
 *  opacity: 1;
 * }
 * </style>
 *
 * <div class="view-container">
 *   <div ng-view class="reveal-animation"></div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * The following code below demonstrates how to perform animations using **CSS animations** with Angular:
 *
 * ```html
 * <style type="text/css">
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter {
 *   -webkit-animation: enter_sequence 1s linear; /&#42; Safari/Chrome &#42;/
 *   animation: enter_sequence 1s linear; /&#42; IE10+ and Future Browsers &#42;/
 * }
 * @-webkit-keyframes enter_sequence {
 *   from { opacity:0; }
 *   to { opacity:1; }
 * }
 * @keyframes enter_sequence {
 *   from { opacity:0; }
 *   to { opacity:1; }
 * }
 * </style>
 *
 * <div class="view-container">
 *   <div ng-view class="reveal-animation"></div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * Both CSS3 animations and transitions can be used together and the animate service will figure out the correct duration and delay timing.
 *
 * Upon DOM mutation, the event class is added first (something like `ng-enter`), then the browser prepares itself to add
 * the active class (in this case `ng-enter-active`) which then triggers the animation. The animation module will automatically
 * detect the CSS code to determine when the animation ends. Once the animation is over then both CSS classes will be
 * removed from the DOM. If a browser does not support CSS transitions or CSS animations then the animation will start and end
 * immediately resulting in a DOM element that is at its final state. This final state is when the DOM element
 * has no CSS transition/animation classes applied to it.
 *
 * ### Structural transition animations
 *
 * Structural transitions (such as enter, leave and move) will always apply a `0s none` transition
 * value to force the browser into rendering the styles defined in the setup (`.ng-enter`, `.ng-leave`
 * or `.ng-move`) class. This means that any active transition animations operating on the element
 * will be cut off to make way for the enter, leave or move animation.
 *
 * ### Class-based transition animations
 *
 * Class-based transitions refer to transition animations that are triggered when a CSS class is
 * added to or removed from the element (via `$animate.addClass`, `$animate.removeClass`,
 * `$animate.setClass`, or by directives such as `ngClass`, `ngModel` and `form`).
 * They are different when compared to structural animations since they **do not cancel existing
 * animations** nor do they **block successive transitions** from rendering on the same element.
 * This distinction allows for **multiple class-based transitions** to be performed on the same element.
 *
 * In addition to ngAnimate supporting the default (natural) functionality of class-based transition
 * animations, ngAnimate also decorates the element with starting and ending CSS classes to aid the
 * developer in further styling the element throughout the transition animation. Earlier versions
 * of ngAnimate may have caused natural CSS transitions to break and not render properly due to
 * $animate temporarily blocking transitions using `0s none` in order to allow the setup CSS class
 * (the `-add` or `-remove` class) to be applied without triggering an animation. However, as of
 * **version 1.3**, this workaround has been removed with ngAnimate and all non-ngAnimate CSS
 * class transitions are compatible with ngAnimate.
 *
 * There is, however, one special case when dealing with class-based transitions in ngAnimate.
 * When rendering class-based transitions that make use of the setup and active CSS classes
 * (e.g. `.fade-add` and `.fade-add-active` for when `.fade` is added) be sure to define
 * the transition value **on the active CSS class** and not the setup class.
 *
 * ```css
 * .fade-add {
 *   /&#42; remember to place a 0s transition here
 *      to ensure that the styles are applied instantly
 *      even if the element already has a transition style &#42;/
 *   transition:0s linear all;
 *
 *   /&#42; starting CSS styles &#42;/
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * .fade-add.fade-add-active {
 *   /&#42; this will be the length of the animation &#42;/
 *   transition:1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The setup CSS class (in this case `.fade-add`) also has a transition style property, however, it
 * has a duration of zero. This may not be required, however, incase the browser is unable to render
 * the styling present in this CSS class instantly then it could be that the browser is attempting
 * to perform an unnecessary transition.
 *
 * This workaround, however, does not apply to  standard class-based transitions that are rendered
 * when a CSS class containing a transition is applied to an element:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; this works as expected &#42;/
 * .fade {
 *   transition:1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Please keep this in mind when coding the CSS markup that will be used within class-based transitions.
 * Also, try not to mix the two class-based animation flavors together since the CSS code may become
 * overly complex.
 *
 *
 * ### Preventing Collisions With Third Party Libraries
 *
 * Some third-party frameworks place animation duration defaults across many element or className
 * selectors in order to make their code small and reuseable. This can lead to issues with ngAnimate, which
 * is expecting actual animations on these elements and has to wait for their completion.
 *
 * You can prevent this unwanted behavior by using a prefix on all your animation classes:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; prefixed with animate- &#42;/
 * .animate-fade-add.animate-fade-add-active {
 *   transition:1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You then configure `$animate` to enforce this prefix:
 *
 * ```js
 * $animateProvider.classNameFilter(/animate-/);
 * ```
 * </div>
 *
 * ### CSS Staggering Animations
 * A Staggering animation is a collection of animations that are issued with a slight delay in between each successive operation resulting in a
 * curtain-like effect. The ngAnimate module (versions >=1.2) supports staggering animations and the stagger effect can be
 * performed by creating a **ng-EVENT-stagger** CSS class and attaching that class to the base CSS class used for
 * the animation. The style property expected within the stagger class can either be a **transition-delay** or an
 * **animation-delay** property (or both if your animation contains both transitions and keyframe animations).
 *
 * ```css
 * .my-animation.ng-enter {
 *   /&#42; standard transition code &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition: 1s linear all;
 *   transition: 1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * .my-animation.ng-enter-stagger {
 *   /&#42; this will have a 100ms delay between each successive leave animation &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition-delay: 0.1s;
 *   transition-delay: 0.1s;
 *
 *   /&#42; in case the stagger doesn't work then these two values
 *    must be set to 0 to avoid an accidental CSS inheritance &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition-duration: 0s;
 *   transition-duration: 0s;
 * }
 * .my-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *   /&#42; standard transition styles &#42;/
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Staggering animations work by default in ngRepeat (so long as the CSS class is defined). Outside of ngRepeat, to use staggering animations
 * on your own, they can be triggered by firing multiple calls to the same event on $animate. However, the restrictions surrounding this
 * are that each of the elements must have the same CSS className value as well as the same parent element. A stagger operation
 * will also be reset if more than 10ms has passed after the last animation has been fired.
 *
 * The following code will issue the **ng-leave-stagger** event on the element provided:
 *
 * ```js
 * var kids = parent.children();
 *
 * $animate.leave(kids[0]); //stagger index=0
 * $animate.leave(kids[1]); //stagger index=1
 * $animate.leave(kids[2]); //stagger index=2
 * $animate.leave(kids[3]); //stagger index=3
 * $animate.leave(kids[4]); //stagger index=4
 *
 * $timeout(function() {
 *   //stagger has reset itself
 *   $animate.leave(kids[5]); //stagger index=0
 *   $animate.leave(kids[6]); //stagger index=1
 * }, 100, false);
 * ```
 *
 * Stagger animations are currently only supported within CSS-defined animations.
 *
 * ## JavaScript-defined Animations
 * In the event that you do not want to use CSS3 transitions or CSS3 animations or if you wish to offer animations on browsers that do not
 * yet support CSS transitions/animations, then you can make use of JavaScript animations defined inside of your AngularJS module.
 *
 * ```js
 * //!annotate="YourApp" Your AngularJS Module|Replace this or ngModule with the module that you used to define your application.
 * var ngModule = angular.module('YourApp', ['ngAnimate']);
 * ngModule.animation('.my-crazy-animation', function() {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element, done) {
 *       //run the animation here and call done when the animation is complete
 *       return function(cancelled) {
 *         //this (optional) function will be called when the animation
 *         //completes or when the animation is cancelled (the cancelled
 *         //flag will be set to true if cancelled).
 *       };
 *     },
 *     leave: function(element, done) { },
 *     move: function(element, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered before the class is added
 *     beforeAddClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered after the class is added
 *     addClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered before the class is removed
 *     beforeRemoveClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered after the class is removed
 *     removeClass: function(element, className, done) { }
 *   };
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * JavaScript-defined animations are created with a CSS-like class selector and a collection of events which are set to run
 * a javascript callback function. When an animation is triggered, $animate will look for a matching animation which fits
 * the element's CSS class attribute value and then run the matching animation event function (if found).
 * In other words, if the CSS classes present on the animated element match any of the JavaScript animations then the callback function will
 * be executed. It should be also noted that only simple, single class selectors are allowed (compound class selectors are not supported).
 *
 * Within a JavaScript animation, an object containing various event callback animation functions is expected to be returned.
 * As explained above, these callbacks are triggered based on the animation event. Therefore if an enter animation is run,
 * and the JavaScript animation is found, then the enter callback will handle that animation (in addition to the CSS keyframe animation
 * or transition code that is defined via a stylesheet).
 *
 *
 * ### Applying Directive-specific Styles to an Animation
 * In some cases a directive or service may want to provide `$animate` with extra details that the animation will
 * include into its animation. Let's say for example we wanted to render an animation that animates an element
 * towards the mouse coordinates as to where the user clicked last. By collecting the X/Y coordinates of the click
 * (via the event parameter) we can set the `top` and `left` styles into an object and pass that into our function
 * call to `$animate.addClass`.
 *
 * ```js
 * canvas.on('click', function(e) {
 *   $animate.addClass(element, 'on', {
 *     to: {
 *       left : e.client.x + 'px',
 *       top : e.client.y + 'px'
 *     }
 *   }):
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Now when the animation runs, and a transition or keyframe animation is picked up, then the animation itself will
 * also include and transition the styling of the `left` and `top` properties into its running animation. If we want
 * to provide some starting animation values then we can do so by placing the starting animations styles into an object
 * called `from` in the same object as the `to` animations.
 *
 * ```js
 * canvas.on('click', function(e) {
 *   $animate.addClass(element, 'on', {
 *     from: {
 *        position: 'absolute',
 *        left: '0px',
 *        top: '0px'
 *     },
 *     to: {
 *       left : e.client.x + 'px',
 *       top : e.client.y + 'px'
 *     }
 *   }):
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Once the animation is complete or cancelled then the union of both the before and after styles are applied to the
 * element. If `ngAnimate` is not present then the styles will be applied immediately.

      /**
       * @ngdoc service
       * @name $animate
       * @kind object
       *
       * @description
       * The `$animate` service provides animation detection support while performing DOM operations (enter, leave and move) as well as during addClass and removeClass operations.
       * When any of these operations are run, the $animate service
       * will examine any JavaScript-defined animations (which are defined by using the $animateProvider provider object)
       * as well as any CSS-defined animations against the CSS classes present on the element once the DOM operation is run.
       *
       * The `$animate` service is used behind the scenes with pre-existing directives and animation with these directives
       * will work out of the box without any extra configuration.
       *
       * Requires the {@link ngAnimate `ngAnimate`} module to be installed.
       *
       * Please visit the {@link ngAnimate `ngAnimate`} module overview page learn more about how to use animations in your application.
       * ## Callback Promises
       * With AngularJS 1.3, each of the animation methods, on the `$animate` service, return a promise when called. The
       * promise itself is then resolved once the animation has completed itself, has been cancelled or has been
       * skipped due to animations being disabled. (Note that even if the animation is cancelled it will still
       * call the resolve function of the animation.)
       *
       * ```js
       * $animate.enter(element, container).then(function() {
       *   //...this is called once the animation is complete...
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * Also note that, due to the nature of the callback promise, if any Angular-specific code (like changing the scope,
       * location of the page, etc...) is executed within the callback promise then be sure to wrap the code using
       * `$scope.$apply(...)`;
       *
       * ```js
       * $animate.leave(element).then(function() {
       *   $scope.$apply(function() {
       *     $location.path('/new-page');
       *   });
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * An animation can also be cancelled by calling the `$animate.cancel(promise)` method with the provided
       * promise that was returned when the animation was started.
       *
       * ```js
       * var promise = $animate.addClass(element, 'super-long-animation');
       * promise.then(function() {
       *   //this will still be called even if cancelled
       * });
       *
       * element.on('click', function() {
       *   //tooo lazy to wait for the animation to end
       *   $animate.cancel(promise);
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * (Keep in mind that the promise cancellation is unique to `$animate` since promises in
       * general cannot be cancelled.)
       *

         * |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
         * | 1. `$animate.animate(...)` is called                                                                                  | `class="my-animation"`                                       |
         * | 2. `$animate` waits for the next digest to start the animation                                                        | `class="my-animation ng-animate"`                            |
         * | 3. `$animate` runs the JavaScript-defined animations detected on the element                                          | `class="my-animation ng-animate"`                            |
         * | 4. the `className` class value is added to the element                                                                | `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 5. `$animate` scans the element styles to get the CSS transition/animation duration and delay                         | `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 6. `$animate` blocks all CSS transitions on the element to ensure the `.className` class styling is applied right away| `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 7. `$animate` applies the provided collection of `from` CSS styles to the element                                     | `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 8. `$animate` waits for a single animation frame (this performs a reflow)                                             | `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 9. `$animate` removes the CSS transition block placed on the element                                                  | `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 10. the `className-active` class is added (this triggers the CSS transition/animation)                                | `class="my-animation ng-animate className className-active"` |
         * | 11. `$animate` applies the collection of `to` CSS styles to the element which are then handled by the transition      | `class="my-animation ng-animate className className-active"` |
         * | 12. `$animate` waits for the animation to complete (via events and timeout)                                           | `class="my-animation ng-animate className className-active"` |
         * | 13. The animation ends and all generated CSS classes are removed from the element                                     | `class="my-animation"`                                       |

         * Triggers a custom animation event based off the className variable and then removes the CSS class provided by the className value
         * from the element. Unlike the other animation methods, the animate service will suffix the className value with {@type -remove} in
         * order to provide the animate service the setup and active CSS classes in order to trigger the animation (this will be skipped if
         * no CSS transitions or keyframes are defined on the -remove or base CSS classes).
         *
         * Below is a breakdown of each step that occurs during removeClass animation:

   *
   * @description
   * Resolves a set of invocables. An invocable is a function to be invoked via 
   * `$injector.invoke()`, and can have an arbitrary number of dependencies. 
   * An invocable can either return a value directly,
   * or a `$q` promise. If a promise is returned it will be resolved and the 
   * resulting value will be used instead. Dependencies of invocables are resolved 
   * (in this order of precedence)
   *
   * - from the specified `locals`
   * - from another invocable that is part of this `$resolve` call
   * - from an invocable that is inherited from a `parent` call to `$resolve` 
   *   (or recursively
   * - from any ancestor `$resolve` of that parent).
   *
   * The return value of `$resolve` is a promise for an object that contains 
   * (in this order of precedence)
   *
   * - any `locals` (if specified)
   * - the resolved return values of all injectables
   * - any values inherited from a `parent` call to `$resolve` (if specified)
   *
   * The promise will resolve after the `parent` promise (if any) and all promises 
   * returned by injectables have been resolved. If any invocable 
   * (or `$injector.invoke`) throws an exception, or if a promise returned by an 
   * invocable is rejected, the `$resolve` promise is immediately rejected with the 
   * same error. A rejection of a `parent` promise (if specified) will likewise be 
   * propagated immediately. Once the `$resolve` promise has been rejected, no 
   * further invocables will be called.
   * 
   * Cyclic dependencies between invocables are not permitted and will caues `$resolve`
   * to throw an error. As a special case, an injectable can depend on a parameter 
   * with the same name as the injectable, which will be fulfilled from the `parent` 
   * injectable of the same name. This allows inherited values to be decorated. 
   * Note that in this case any other injectable in the same `$resolve` with the same
   * dependency would see the decorated value, not the inherited value.
   *
   * Note that missing dependencies -- unlike cyclic dependencies -- will cause an 
   * (asynchronous) rejection of the `$resolve` promise rather than a (synchronous) 
   * exception.
   *
   * Invocables are invoked eagerly as soon as all dependencies are available. 
   * This is true even for dependencies inherited from a `parent` call to `$resolve`.
   *
   * As a special case, an invocable can be a string, in which case it is taken to 
   * be a service name to be passed to `$injector.get()`. This is supported primarily 
   * for backwards-compatibility with the `resolve` property of `$routeProvider` 
   * routes.
   *
   * @param {object} invocables functions to invoke or 
   * `$injector` services to fetch.
   * @param {object} locals  values to make available to the injectables
   * @param {object} parent  a promise returned by another call to `$resolve`.
   * @param {object} self  the `this` for the invoked methods
   * @return {object} Promise for an object that contains the resolved return value
   * of all invocables, as well as any inherited and local values.

/**
 * @ngdoc object
 * @name ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher
 *
 * @description
 * Matches URLs against patterns and extracts named parameters from the path or the search
 * part of the URL. A URL pattern consists of a path pattern, optionally followed by '?' and a list
 * of search parameters. Multiple search parameter names are separated by '&'. Search parameters
 * do not influence whether or not a URL is matched, but their values are passed through into
 * the matched parameters returned by {@link ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher#methods_exec exec}.
 *
 * Path parameter placeholders can be specified using simple colon/catch-all syntax or curly brace
 * syntax, which optionally allows a regular expression for the parameter to be specified:
 *
 * * `':'` name - colon placeholder
 * * `'*'` name - catch-all placeholder
 * * `'{' name '}'` - curly placeholder
 * * `'{' name ':' regexp|type '}'` - curly placeholder with regexp or type name. Should the
 *   regexp itself contain curly braces, they must be in matched pairs or escaped with a backslash.
 *
 * Parameter names may contain only word characters (latin letters, digits, and underscore) and
 * must be unique within the pattern (across both path and search parameters). For colon
 * placeholders or curly placeholders without an explicit regexp, a path parameter matches any
 * number of characters other than '/'. For catch-all placeholders the path parameter matches
 * any number of characters.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * * `'/hello/'` - Matches only if the path is exactly '/hello/'. There is no special treatment for
 *   trailing slashes, and patterns have to match the entire path, not just a prefix.
 * * `'/user/:id'` - Matches '/user/bob' or '/user/1234!!!' or even '/user/' but not '/user' or
 *   '/user/bob/details'. The second path segment will be captured as the parameter 'id'.
 * * `'/user/{id}'` - Same as the previous example, but using curly brace syntax.
 * * `'/user/{id:[^/]*}'` - Same as the previous example.
 * * `'/user/{id:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,8}}'` - Similar to the previous example, but only matches if the id
 *   parameter consists of 1 to 8 hex digits.
 * * `'/files/{path:.*}'` - Matches any URL starting with '/files/' and captures the rest of the
 *   path into the parameter 'path'.
 * * `'/files/*path'` - ditto.
 * * `'/calendar/{start:date}'` - Matches "/calendar/2014-11-12" (because the pattern defined
 *   in the built-in  `date` Type matches `2014-11-12`) and provides a Date object in $stateParams.start
 *
 * @param {string} pattern  The pattern to compile into a matcher.
 * @param {Object} config  A configuration object hash:
 * @param {Object=} parentMatcher Used to concatenate the pattern/config onto
 *   an existing UrlMatcher
 *
 * * `caseInsensitive` - `true` if URL matching should be case insensitive, otherwise `false`, the default value (for backward compatibility) is `false`.
 * * `strict` - `false` if matching against a URL with a trailing slash should be treated as equivalent to a URL without a trailing slash, the default value is `true`.
 *
 * @property {string} prefix  A static prefix of this pattern. The matcher guarantees that any
 *   URL matching this matcher (i.e. any string for which {@link ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher#methods_exec exec()} returns
 *   non-null) will start with this prefix.
 *
 * @property {string} source  The pattern that was passed into the constructor
 *
 * @property {string} sourcePath  The path portion of the source property
 *
 * @property {string} sourceSearch  The search portion of the source property
 *
 * @property {string} regex  The constructed regex that will be used to match against the url when
 *   it is time to determine which url will match.
 *
 * @returns {Object}  New `UrlMatcher` object

   * generate URLs with typed parameters.
   *
   * @param {string} name  The type name.
   * @param {Object|Function} definition   The type definition. See
   *        {@link ui.router.util.type:Type `Type`} for information on the values accepted.
   * @param {Object|Function} definitionFn (optional) A function that is injected before the app
   *        runtime starts.  The result of this function is merged into the existing `definition`.
   *        See {@link ui.router.util.type:Type `Type`} for information on the values accepted.
   *
   * @returns {Object}  Returns `$urlMatcherFactoryProvider`.
   *
   * @example
   * This is a simple example of a custom type that encodes and decodes items from an
   * array, using the array index as the URL-encoded value:
   *
   * <pre>
   * var list = ['John', 'Paul', 'George', 'Ringo'];
   *
   * $urlMatcherFactoryProvider.type('listItem', {
   *   encode: function(item) {
   *     // Represent the list item in the URL using its corresponding index
   *     return list.indexOf(item);
   *   },
   *   decode: function(item) {
   *     // Look up the list item by index
   *     return list[parseInt(item, 10)];
   *   },
   *   is: function(item) {
   *     // Ensure the item is valid by checking to see that it appears
   *     // in the list
   *     return list.indexOf(item) > -1;
   *   }
   * });
   *
   * $stateProvider.state('list', {
   *   url: "/list/{item:listItem}",
   *   controller: function($scope, $stateParams) {
   *     console.log($stateParams.item);
   *   }
   * });
   *
   * // ...
   *
   * // Changes URL to '/list/3', logs "Ringo" to the console
   * $state.go('list', { item: "Ringo" });
   * </pre>
   *
   * This is a more complex example of a type that relies on dependency injection to
   * interact with services, and uses the parameter name from the URL to infer how to
   * handle encoding and decoding parameter values:
   *
   * <pre>
   * // Defines a custom type that gets a value from a service,
   * // where each service gets different types of values from
   * // a backend API:
   * $urlMatcherFactoryProvider.type('dbObject', {}, function(Users, Posts) {
   *
   *   // Matches up services to URL parameter names
   *   var services = {
   *     user: Users,
   *     post: Posts
   *   };
   *
   *   return {
   *     encode: function(object) {
   *       // Represent the object in the URL using its unique ID
   *       return object.id;
   *     },
   *     decode: function(value, key) {
   *       // Look up the object by ID, using the parameter
   *       // name (key) to call the correct service
   *       return services[key].findById(value);
   *     },
   *     is: function(object, key) {
   *       // Check that object is a valid dbObject
   *       return angular.isObject(object) && object.id && services[key];
   *     }
   *     equals: function(a, b) {
   *       // Check the equality of decoded objects by comparing
   *       // their unique IDs
   *       return a.id === b.id;
   *     }
   *   };
   * });
   *
   * // In a config() block, you can then attach URLs with
   * // type-annotated parameters:
   * $stateProvider.state('users', {
   *   url: "/users",
   *   // ...
   * }).state('users.item', {
   *   url: "/{user:dbObject}",
   *   controller: function($scope, $stateParams) {
   *     // $stateParams.user will now be an object returned from

   * Registers a handler for a given url matching. if handle is a string, it is

   * - **falsy** to indicate that the rule didn't match after all, then `$urlRouter`
   *   will continue trying to find another one that matches.
   * - **string** which is treated as a redirect and passed to `$location.url()`
   * - **void** or any **truthy** value tells `$urlRouter` that the url was handled.

   * necessarily have a good use case for decoration, that is up to you to decide.
   *
   * In addition, users can attach custom decorators, which will generate new 
   * properties within the state's internal definition. There is currently no clear 
   * use-case for this beyond accessing internal states (i.e. $state.$current), 
   * however, expect this to become increasingly relevant as we introduce additional 
   * meta-programming features.
   *
   * **Warning**: Decorators should not be interdependent because the order of 
   * execution of the builder functions in non-deterministic. Builder functions 
   * should only be dependent on the state definition object and super function.
   *
   *
   * Existing builder functions and current return values:
   *
   * - **parent** `{object}` - returns the parent state object.
   * - **data** `{object}` - returns state data, including any inherited data that is not
   *   overridden by own values (if any).
   * - **url** `{object}` - returns a {@link ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher UrlMatcher}
   *   or `null`.
   * - **navigable** `{object}` - returns closest ancestor state that has a URL (aka is 
   *   navigable).
   * - **params** `{object}` - returns an array of state params that are ensured to 
   *   be a super-set of parent's params.
   * - **views** `{object}` - returns a views object where each key is an absolute view 
   *   name (i.e. "viewName@stateName") and each value is the config object 
   *   (template, controller) for the view. Even when you don't use the views object 
   *   explicitly on a state config, one is still created for you internally.
   *   So by decorating this builder function you have access to decorating template 
   *   and controller properties.
   * - **ownParams** `{object}` - returns an array of params that belong to the state, 
   *   not including any params defined by ancestor states.
   * - **path** `{string}` - returns the full path from the root down to this state. 
   *   Needed for state activation.
   * - **includes** `{object}` - returns an object that includes every state that 
   *   would pass a `$state.includes()` test.
   *
   * @example
   * <pre>
   * // Override the internal 'views' builder with a function that takes the state
   * // definition, and a reference to the internal function being overridden:
   * $stateProvider.decorator('views', function (state, parent) {
   *   var result = {},
   *       views = parent(state);
   *
   *   angular.forEach(views, function (config, name) {
   *     var autoName = (state.name + '.' + name).replace('.', '/');
   *     config.templateUrl = config.templateUrl || '/partials/' + autoName + '.html';
   *     result[name] = config;
   *   });
   *   return result;
   * });
   *
   * $stateProvider.state('home', {
   *   views: {
   *     'contact.list': { controller: 'ListController' },
   *     'contact.item': { controller: 'ItemController' }

   * @ngdoc function
   * @name ui.router.state.$stateProvider#state
   * @methodOf ui.router.state.$stateProvider
   *
   * @description
   * Registers a state configuration under a given state name. The stateConfig object
   * has the following acceptable properties.
   *
   * @param {string} name A unique state name, e.g. "home", "about", "contacts".
   * To create a parent/child state use a dot, e.g. "about.sales", "home.newest".
   * @param {object} stateConfig State configuration object.
   * @param {string|function=} stateConfig.template
   * <a id='template'></a>
   *   html template as a string or a function that returns
   *   an html template as a string which should be used by the uiView directives. This property 
   *   takes precedence over templateUrl.
   *   
   *   If `template` is a function, it will be called with the following parameters:
   *
   *   - {array.&lt;object&gt;} - state parameters extracted from the current $location.path() by
   *     applying the current state
   *
   * <pre>template:

   * </div>
   *
   * @param {string|function=} stateConfig.templateUrl
   * <a id='templateUrl'></a>
   *
   *   path or function that returns a path to an html
   *   template that should be used by uiView.
   *   
   *   If `templateUrl` is a function, it will be called with the following parameters:
   *
   *   - {array.&lt;object&gt;} - state parameters extracted from the current $location.path() by 
   *     applying the current state
   *
   * <pre>templateUrl: "home.html"</pre>
   * <pre>templateUrl: function(params) {
   *     return myTemplates[params.pageId]; }</pre>
   *
   * @param {function=} stateConfig.templateProvider
   * <a id='templateProvider'></a>
   *    Provider function that returns HTML content string.
   * <pre> templateProvider:

   *         return MyTemplateService.getTemplate(params.pageId);
   *       }</pre>
   *
   * @param {string|function=} stateConfig.controller
   * <a id='controller'></a>
   *
   *  Controller fn that should be associated with newly
   *   related scope or the name of a registered controller if passed as a string.
   *   Optionally, the ControllerAs may be declared here.
   * <pre>controller: "MyRegisteredController"</pre>
   * <pre>controller:
   *     "MyRegisteredController as fooCtrl"}</pre>
   * <pre>controller: function($scope, MyService) {
   *     $scope.data = MyService.getData(); }</pre>
   *
   * @param {function=} stateConfig.controllerProvider
   * <a id='controllerProvider'></a>
   *
   * Injectable provider function that returns the actual controller or string.
   * <pre>controllerProvider:
   *   function(MyResolveData) {
   *     if (MyResolveData.foo)
   *       return "FooCtrl"

   *     }
   *   }</pre>
   *
   * @param {string=} stateConfig.controllerAs
   * <a id='controllerAs'></a>
   * 
   * A controller alias name. If present the controller will be
   *   published to scope under the controllerAs name.
   * <pre>controllerAs: "myCtrl"</pre>
   *
   * @param {string|object=} stateConfig.parent
   * <a id='parent'></a>
   * Optionally specifies the parent state of this state.
   *
   * <pre>parent: 'parentState'</pre>
   * <pre>parent: parentState // JS variable</pre>
   *
   * @param {object=} stateConfig.resolve
   * <a id='resolve'></a>
   *
   * An optional map&lt;string, function&gt; of dependencies which
   *   should be injected into the controller. If any of these dependencies are promises, 
   *   the router will wait for them all to be resolved before the controller is instantiated.
   *   If all the promises are resolved successfully, the $stateChangeSuccess event is fired
   *   and the values of the resolved promises are injected into any controllers that reference them.
   *   If any  of the promises are rejected the $stateChangeError event is fired.
   *
   *   The map object is:
   *   
   *   - key - {string}: name of dependency to be injected into controller
   *   - factory - {string|function}: If string then it is alias for service. Otherwise if function, 
   *     it is injected and return value it treated as dependency. If result is a promise, it is 
   *     resolved before its value is injected into controller.
   *
   * <pre>resolve: {
   *     myResolve1:
   *       function($http, $stateParams) {
   *         return $http.get("/api/foos/"+stateParams.fooID);
   *       }
   *     }</pre>
   *
   * @param {string=} stateConfig.url
   * <a id='url'></a>
   *
   *   A url fragment with optional parameters. When a state is navigated or
   *   transitioned to, the `$stateParams` service will be populated with any 
   *   parameters that were passed.
   *
   *   (See {@link ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher UrlMatcher} `UrlMatcher`} for
   *   more details on acceptable patterns )
   *
   * examples:
   * <pre>url: "/home"
   * url: "/users/:userid"
   * url: "/books/{bookid:[a-zA-Z_-]}"
   * url: "/books/{categoryid:int}"
   * url: "/books/{publishername:string}/{categoryid:int}"
   * url: "/messages?before&after"
   * url: "/messages?{before:date}&{after:date}"
   * url: "/messages/:mailboxid?{before:date}&{after:date}"
   * </pre>
   *
   * @param {object=} stateConfig.views
   * <a id='views'></a>
   * an optional map&lt;string, object&gt; which defined multiple views, or targets views
   * manually/explicitly.
   *
   * Examples:
   *
   * Targets three named `ui-view`s in the parent state's template
   * <pre>views: {
   *     header: {
   *       controller: "headerCtrl",
   *       templateUrl: "header.html"
   *     }, body: {
   *       controller: "bodyCtrl",
   *       templateUrl: "body.html"
   *     }, footer: {
   *       controller: "footCtrl",
   *       templateUrl: "footer.html"
   *     }
   *   }</pre>
   *
   * Targets named `ui-view="header"` from grandparent state 'top''s template, and named `ui-view="body" from parent state's template.
   * <pre>views: {
   *     'header@top': {
   *       controller: "msgHeaderCtrl",
   *       templateUrl: "msgHeader.html"
   *     }, 'body': {
   *       controller: "messagesCtrl",
   *       templateUrl: "messages.html"
   *     }
   *   }</pre>
   *
   * @param {boolean=} [stateConfig.abstract=false]
   * <a id='abstract'></a>
   * An abstract state will never be directly activated,
   *   but can provide inherited properties to its common children states.
   * <pre>abstract: true</pre>
   *
   * @param {function=} stateConfig.onEnter
   * <a id='onEnter'></a>
   *
   * Callback function for when a state is entered. Good way
   *   to trigger an action or dispatch an event, such as opening a dialog.
   * If minifying your scripts, make sure to explictly annotate this function,
   * because it won't be automatically annotated by your build tools.
   *
   * <pre>onEnter: function(MyService, $stateParams) {
   *     MyService.foo($stateParams.myParam);
   * }</pre>
   *
   * @param {function=} stateConfig.onExit
   * <a id='onExit'></a>
   *
   * Callback function for when a state is exited. Good way to
   *   trigger an action or dispatch an event, such as opening a dialog.
   * If minifying your scripts, make sure to explictly annotate this function,
   * because it won't be automatically annotated by your build tools.
   *
   * <pre>onExit: function(MyService, $stateParams) {
   *     MyService.cleanup($stateParams.myParam);
   * }</pre>
   *
   * @param {boolean=} [stateConfig.reloadOnSearch=true]
   * <a id='reloadOnSearch'></a>
   *
   * If `false`, will not retrigger the same state
   *   just because a search/query parameter has changed (via $location.search() or $location.hash()). 
   *   Useful for when you'd like to modify $location.search() without triggering a reload.
   * <pre>reloadOnSearch: false</pre>
   *
   * @param {object=} stateConfig.data
   * <a id='data'></a>
   *
   * Arbitrary data object, useful for custom configuration.  The parent state's `data` is
   *   prototypally inherited.  In other words, adding a data property to a state adds it to
   *   the entire subtree via prototypal inheritance.
   *
   * <pre>data: {
   *     requiredRole: 'foo'
   * } </pre>
   *
   * @param {object=} stateConfig.params
   * <a id='params'></a>
   *
   * A map which optionally configures parameters declared in the `url`, or
   *   defines additional non-url parameters.  For each parameter being
   *   configured, add a configuration object keyed to the name of the parameter.
   *
   *   Each parameter configuration object may contain the following properties:
   *
   *   - ** value ** - {object|function=}: specifies the default value for this
   *     parameter.  This implicitly sets this parameter as optional.
   *
   *     When UI-Router routes to a state and no value is
   *     specified for this parameter in the URL or transition, the
   *     default value will be used instead.  If `value` is a function,
   *     it will be injected and invoked, and the return value used.
   *
   *     *Note*: `undefined` is treated as "no default value" while `null`
   *     is treated as "the default value is `null`".
   *
   *     *Shorthand*: If you only need to configure the default value of the
   *     parameter, you may use a shorthand syntax.   In the **`params`**
   *     map, instead mapping the param name to a full parameter configuration
   *     object, simply set map it to the default parameter value, e.g.:
   *
   * <pre>// define a parameter's default value
   * params: {
   *     param1: { value: "defaultValue" }
   * }
   * // shorthand default values
   * params: {
   *     param1: "defaultValue",
   *     param2: "param2Default"
   * }</pre>
   *
   *   - ** array ** - {boolean=}: *(default: false)* If true, the param value will be
   *     treated as an array of values.  If you specified a Type, the value will be
   *     treated as an array of the specified Type.  Note: query parameter values
   *     default to a special `"auto"` mode.
   *
   *     For query parameters in `"auto"` mode, if multiple  values for a single parameter
   *     are present in the URL (e.g.: `/foo?bar=1&bar=2&bar=3`) then the values
   *     are mapped to an array (e.g.: `{ foo: [ '1', '2', '3' ] }`).  However, if
   *     only one value is present (e.g.: `/foo?bar=1`) then the value is treated as single
   *     value (e.g.: `{ foo: '1' }`).
   *
   * <pre>params: {
   *     param1: { array: true }
   * }</pre>
   *
   *   - ** squash ** - {bool|string=}: `squash` configures how a default parameter value is represented in the URL when
   *     the current parameter value is the same as the default value. If `squash` is not set, it uses the
   *     configured default squash policy.
   *     (See {@link ui.router.util.$urlMatcherFactory#methods_defaultSquashPolicy `defaultSquashPolicy()`})
   *
   *   There are three squash settings:
   *
   *     - false: The parameter's default value is not squashed.  It is encoded and included in the URL
   *     - true: The parameter's default value is omitted from the URL.  If the parameter is preceeded and followed
   *       by slashes in the state's `url` declaration, then one of those slashes are omitted.
   *       This can allow for cleaner looking URLs.
   *     - `"<arbitrary string>"`: The parameter's default value is replaced with an arbitrary placeholder of  your choice.
   *
   * <pre>params: {
   *     param1: {
   *       value: "defaultId",
   *       squash: true
   * } }
   * // squash "defaultValue" to "~"
   * params: {
   *     param1: {
   *       value: "defaultValue",
   *       squash: "~"
   * } }
   * </pre>
   *
   *
   * @example
   * <pre>
   * // Some state name examples
   *
   * // stateName can be a single top-level name (must be unique).
   * $stateProvider.state("home", {});
   *
   * // Or it can be a nested state name. This state is a child of the
   * // above "home" state.
   * $stateProvider.state("home.newest", {});
   *
   * // Nest states as deeply as needed.
   * $stateProvider.state("home.newest.abc.xyz.inception", {});
   *
   * // state() returns $stateProvider, so you can chain state declarations.
   * $stateProvider
   *   .state("home", {})
   *   .state("about", {})
   *   .state("contacts", {});

     * @methodOf ui.router.state.$state
     *
     * @description
     * Convenience method for transitioning to a new state. `$state.go` calls 
     * `$state.transitionTo` internally but automatically sets options to 
     * `{ location: true, inherit: true, relative: $state.$current, notify: true }`. 
     * This allows you to easily use an absolute or relative to path and specify 
     * only the parameters you'd like to update (while letting unspecified parameters 
     * inherit from the currently active ancestor states).
     *
     * @example
     * <pre>
     * var app = angular.module('app', ['ui.router']);
     *
     * app.controller('ctrl', function ($scope, $state) {
     *   $scope.changeState = function () {
     *     $state.go('contact.detail');
     *   };
     * });
     * </pre>
     * <img src='../ngdoc_assets/StateGoExamples.png'/>
     *
     * @param {string} to Absolute state name or relative state path. Some examples:
     *
     * - `$state.go('contact.detail')` - will go to the `contact.detail` state
     * - `$state.go('^')` - will go to a parent state
     * - `$state.go('^.sibling')` - will go to a sibling state
     * - `$state.go('.child.grandchild')` - will go to grandchild state
     *
     * @param {object=} params A map of the parameters that will be sent to the state, 
     * will populate $stateParams. Any parameters that are not specified will be inherited from currently 
     * defined parameters. This allows, for example, going to a sibling state that shares parameters
     * specified in a parent state. Parameter inheritance only works between common ancestor states, I.e.
     * transitioning to a sibling will get you the parameters for all parents, transitioning to a child
     * will get you all current parameters, etc.
     * @param {object=} options Options object. The options are:
     *
     * - **`location`** - {boolean=true|string=} - If `true` will update the url in the location bar, if `false`
     *    will not. If string, must be `"replace"`, which will update url and also replace last history record.
     * - **`inherit`** - {boolean=true}, If `true` will inherit url parameters from current url.
     * - **`relative`** - {object=$state.$current}, When transitioning with relative path (e.g '^'), 
     *    defines which state to be relative from.
     * - **`notify`** - {boolean=true}, If `true` will broadcast $stateChangeStart and $stateChangeSuccess events.
     * - **`reload`** (v0.2.5) - {boolean=false}, If `true` will force transition even if the state or params 
     *    have not changed, aka a reload of the same state. It differs from reloadOnSearch because you'd
     *    use this when you want to force a reload when *everything* is the same, including search params.
     *
     * @returns {promise} A promise representing the state of the new transition.
     *
     * Possible success values:
     *
     * - $state.current
     *
     * <br/>Possible rejection values:
     *
     * - 'transition superseded' - when a newer transition has been started after this one
     * - 'transition prevented' - when `event.preventDefault()` has been called in a `$stateChangeStart` listener
     * - 'transition aborted' - when `event.preventDefault()` has been called in a `$stateNotFound` listener or
     *   when a `$stateNotFound` `event.retry` promise errors.
     * - 'transition failed' - when a state has been unsuccessfully found after 2 tries.
     * - *resolve error* - when an error has occurred with a `resolve`

 * @requires $injector
 * @requires ui.router.state.$uiViewScroll
 * @requires $document
 *
 * @restrict ECA
 *
 * @description
 * The ui-view directive tells $state where to place your templates.
 *
 * @param {string=} name A view name. The name should be unique amongst the other views in the
 * same state. You can have views of the same name that live in different states.
 *
 * @param {string=} autoscroll It allows you to set the scroll behavior of the browser window
 * when a view is populated. By default, $anchorScroll is overridden by ui-router's custom scroll
 * service, {@link ui.router.state.$uiViewScroll}. This custom service let's you
 * scroll ui-view elements into view when they are populated during a state activation.
 *
 * *Note: To revert back to old [`$anchorScroll`](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$anchorScroll)
 * functionality, call `$uiViewScrollProvider.useAnchorScroll()`.*
 *
 * @param {string=} onload Expression to evaluate whenever the view updates.
 * 
 * @example
 * A view can be unnamed or named. 
 * <pre>
 * <!-- Unnamed -->
 * <div ui-view></div> 
 * 
 * <!-- Named -->
 * <div ui-view="viewName"></div>
 * </pre>
 *
 * You can only have one unnamed view within any template (or root html). If you are only using a 
 * single view and it is unnamed then you can populate it like so:
 * <pre>
 * <div ui-view></div> 
 * $stateProvider.state("home", {
 *   template: "<h1>HELLO!</h1>"
 * })
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The above is a convenient shortcut equivalent to specifying your view explicitly with the {@link ui.router.state.$stateProvider#views `views`}
 * config property, by name, in this case an empty name:
 * <pre>
 * $stateProvider.state("home", {
 *   views: {
 *     "": {
 *       template: "<h1>HELLO!</h1>"
 *     }
 *   }    
 * })
 * </pre>
 * 
 * But typically you'll only use the views property if you name your view or have more than one view 
 * in the same template. There's not really a compelling reason to name a view if its the only one, 
 * but you could if you wanted, like so:
 * <pre>
 * <div ui-view="main"></div>
 * </pre> 
 * <pre>
 * $stateProvider.state("home", {
 *   views: {
 *     "main": {
 *       template: "<h1>HELLO!</h1>"
 *     }
 *   }    
 * })
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Really though, you'll use views to set up multiple views:
 * <pre>
 * <div ui-view></div>
 * <div ui-view="chart"></div> 
 * <div ui-view="data"></div> 
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * $stateProvider.state("home", {
 *   views: {
 *     "": {
 *       template: "<h1>HELLO!</h1>"
 *     },
 *     "chart": {
 *       template: "<chart_thing/>"
 *     },
 *     "data": {
 *       template: "<data_thing/>"
 *     }
 *   }    
 * })
 * </pre>
 *
 * Examples for `autoscroll`:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <!-- If autoscroll present with no expression,
 *      then scroll ui-view into view -->
 * <ui-view autoscroll/>
 *
 * <!-- If autoscroll present with valid expression,
 *      then scroll ui-view into view if expression evaluates to true -->
 * <ui-view autoscroll='true'/>
 * <ui-view autoscroll='false'/>
 * <ui-view autoscroll='scopeVariable'/>
 * </pre>

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ui.router.state.directive:ui-sref
 *
 * @requires ui.router.state.$state
 * @requires $timeout
 *
 * @restrict A
 *
 * @description
 * A directive that binds a link (`<a>` tag) to a state. If the state has an associated 
 * URL, the directive will automatically generate & update the `href` attribute via 
 * the {@link ui.router.state.$state#methods_href $state.href()} method. Clicking 
 * the link will trigger a state transition with optional parameters. 
 *
 * Also middle-clicking, right-clicking, and ctrl-clicking on the link will be 
 * handled natively by the browser.
 *
 * You can also use relative state paths within ui-sref, just like the relative 
 * paths passed to `$state.go()`. You just need to be aware that the path is relative
 * to the state that the link lives in, in other words the state that loaded the 
 * template containing the link.
 *
 * You can specify options to pass to {@link ui.router.state.$state#go $state.go()}
 * using the `ui-sref-opts` attribute. Options are restricted to `location`, `inherit`,
 * and `reload`.
 *
 * @example
 * Here's an example of how you'd use ui-sref and how it would compile. If you have the 
 * following template:
 * <pre>
 * <a ui-sref="home">Home</a> | <a ui-sref="about">About</a> | <a ui-sref="{page: 2}">Next page</a>
 * 
 * <ul>
 *     <li ng-repeat="contact in contacts">
 *         <a ui-sref="contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })">{{ contact.name }}</a>
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Then the compiled html would be (assuming Html5Mode is off and current state is contacts):
 * <pre>
 * <a href="#/home" ui-sref="home">Home</a> | <a href="#/about" ui-sref="about">About</a> | <a href="#/contacts?page=2" ui-sref="{page: 2}">Next page</a>
 * 
 * <ul>
 *     <li ng-repeat="contact in contacts">
 *         <a href="#/contacts/1" ui-sref="contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })">Joe</a>
 *     </li>
 *     <li ng-repeat="contact in contacts">
 *         <a href="#/contacts/2" ui-sref="contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })">Alice</a>
 *     </li>
 *     <li ng-repeat="contact in contacts">
 *         <a href="#/contacts/3" ui-sref="contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })">Bob</a>
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <a ui-sref="home" ui-sref-opts="{reload: true}">Home</a>
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param {string} ui-sref 'stateName' can be any valid absolute or relative state
 * @param {Object} ui-sref-opts options to pass to {@link ui.router.state.$state#go $state.go()}

 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ui.router.state.directive:ui-sref-active
 *
 * @requires ui.router.state.$state
 * @requires ui.router.state.$stateParams
 * @requires $interpolate
 *
 * @restrict A
 *
 * @description
 * A directive working alongside ui-sref to add classes to an element when the
 * related ui-sref directive's state is active, and removing them when it is inactive.
 * The primary use-case is to simplify the special appearance of navigation menus
 * relying on `ui-sref`, by having the "active" state's menu button appear different,
 * distinguishing it from the inactive menu items.
 *
 * ui-sref-active can live on the same element as ui-sref or on a parent element. The first
 * ui-sref-active found at the same level or above the ui-sref will be used.
 *
 * Will activate when the ui-sref's target state or any child state is active. If you
 * need to activate only when the ui-sref target state is active and *not* any of
 * it's children, then you will use
 * {@link ui.router.state.directive:ui-sref-active-eq ui-sref-active-eq}
 *
 * @example
 * Given the following template:
 * <pre>
 * <ul>
 *   <li ui-sref-active="active" class="item">
 *     <a href ui-sref="app.user({user: 'bilbobaggins'})">@bilbobaggins</a>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * When the app state is "app.user" (or any children states), and contains the state parameter "user" with value "bilbobaggins",
 * the resulting HTML will appear as (note the 'active' class):
 * <pre>
 * <ul>
 *   <li ui-sref-active="active" class="item active">
 *     <a ui-sref="app.user({user: 'bilbobaggins'})" href="/users/bilbobaggins">@bilbobaggins</a>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * </pre>
 *
 * The class name is interpolated **once** during the directives link time (any further changes to the
 * interpolated value are ignored).
 *
 * Multiple classes may be specified in a space-separated format:
 * <pre>
 * <ul>
 *   <li ui-sref-active='class1 class2 class3'>
 *     <a ui-sref="app.user">link</a>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>

     * @description
     * The `$swipe` service is a service that abstracts the messier details of hold-and-drag swipe
     * behavior, to make implementing swipe-related directives more convenient.
     *
     * Requires the {@link ngTouch `ngTouch`} module to be installed.
     *
     * `$swipe` is used by the `ngSwipeLeft` and `ngSwipeRight` directives in `ngTouch`, and by

     *
     * # Usage
     * The `$swipe` service is an object with a single method: `bind`. `bind` takes an element
     * which is to be watched for swipes, and an object with four handler functions. See the
     * documentation for `bind` below.

     * @description
     * The main method of `$swipe`. It takes an element to be watched for swipe motions, and an
     * object containing event handlers.
     * The pointer types that should be used can be specified via the optional
     * third argument, which is an array of strings `'mouse'` and `'touch'`. By default,
     * `$swipe` will listen for `mouse` and `touch` events.
     *
     * The four events are `start`, `move`, `end`, and `cancel`. `start`, `move`, and `end`
     * receive as a parameter a coordinates object of the form `{ x: 150, y: 310 }` and the raw
     * `event`. `cancel` receives the raw `event` as its single parameter.
     *
     * `start` is called on either `mousedown` or `touchstart`. After this event, `$swipe` is
     * watching for `touchmove` or `mousemove` events. These events are ignored until the total
     * distance moved in either dimension exceeds a small threshold.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngClick
 *
 * @description
 * A more powerful replacement for the default ngClick designed to be used on touchscreen
 * devices. Most mobile browsers wait about 300ms after a tap-and-release before sending
 * the click event. This version handles them immediately, and then prevents the
 * following click event from propagating.
 *
 * Requires the {@link ngTouch `ngTouch`} module to be installed.
 *
 * This directive can fall back to using an ordinary click event, and so works on desktop
 * browsers as well as mobile.
 *
 * This directive also sets the CSS class `ng-click-active` while the element is being held
 * down (by a mouse click or touch) so you can restyle the depressed element if you wish.
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @param {expression} ngClick {@link guide/expression Expression} to evaluate
 * upon tap. (Event object is available as `$event`)
 *
 * @example
    <example module="ngClickExample" deps="angular-touch.js">
      <file name="index.html">
        <button ng-click="count = count + 1" ng-init="count=0">

  // TAP EVENTS AND GHOST CLICKS
  //
  // Why tap events?
  // Mobile browsers detect a tap, then wait a moment (usually ~300ms) to see if you're
  // double-tapping, and then fire a click event.
  //
  // This delay sucks and makes mobile apps feel unresponsive.
  // So we detect touchstart, touchcancel and touchend ourselves and determine when
  // the user has tapped on something.
  //
  // What happens when the browser then generates a click event?
  // The browser, of course, also detects the tap and fires a click after a delay. This results in
  // tapping/clicking twice. We do "clickbusting" to prevent it.
  //
  // How does it work?
  // We attach global touchstart and click handlers, that run during the capture (early) phase.
  // So the sequence for a tap is:
  // - global touchstart: Sets an "allowable region" at the point touched.
  // - element's touchstart: Starts a touch
  // (- touchcancel ends the touch, no click follows)
  // - element's touchend: Determines if the tap is valid (didn't move too far away, didn't hold
  //   too long) and fires the user's tap handler. The touchend also calls preventGhostClick().
  // - preventGhostClick() removes the allowable region the global touchstart created.
  // - The browser generates a click event.
  // - The global click handler catches the click, and checks whether it was in an allowable region.
  //     - If preventGhostClick was called, the region will have been removed, the click is busted.
  //     - If the region is still there, the click proceeds normally. Therefore clicks on links and
  //       other elements without ngTap on them work normally.
  //
  // This is an ugly, terrible hack!
  // Yeah, tell me about it. The alternatives are using the slow click events, or making our users
  // deal with the ghost clicks, so I consider this the least of evils. Fortunately Angular
  // encapsulates this ugly logic away from the user.
  //
  // Why not just put click handlers on the element?
  // We do that too, just to be sure. If the tap event caused the DOM to change,
  // it is possible another element is now in that position. To take account for these possibly
  // distinct elements, the handlers are global and care only about coordinates.

  // Checks if the coordinates are close enough to be within the region.

/**
 * @ngdoc module
 * @name ngMessages
 * @description
 *
 * The `ngMessages` module provides enhanced support for displaying messages within templates
 * (typically within forms or when rendering message objects that return key/value data).
 * Instead of relying on JavaScript code and/or complex ng-if statements within your form template to
 * show and hide error messages specific to the state of an input field, the `ngMessages` and
 * `ngMessage` directives are designed to handle the complexity, inheritance and priority
 * sequencing based on the order of how the messages are defined in the template.
 *
 * Currently, the ngMessages module only contains the code for the `ngMessages`, `ngMessagesInclude`
 * `ngMessage` and `ngMessageExp` directives.
 *
 * # Usage
 * The `ngMessages` directive listens on a key/value collection which is set on the ngMessages attribute.
 * Since the {@link ngModel ngModel} directive exposes an `$error` object, this error object can be
 * used with `ngMessages` to display control error messages in an easier way than with just regular angular
 * template directives.
 *
 * ```html
 * <form name="myForm">
 *   <label>
 *     Enter text:
 *     <input type="text" ng-model="field" name="myField" required minlength="5" />
 *   </label>
 *   <div ng-messages="myForm.myField.$error" role="alert">
 *     <div ng-message="required">You did not enter a field</div>
 *     <div ng-message="minlength, maxlength">
 *       Your email must be between 5 and 100 characters long
 *     </div>
 *   </div>
 * </form>
 * ```
 *
 * Now whatever key/value entries are present within the provided object (in this case `$error`) then
 * the ngMessages directive will render the inner first ngMessage directive (depending if the key values
 * match the attribute value present on each ngMessage directive). In other words, if your errors
 * object contains the following data:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * <!-- keep in mind that ngModel automatically sets these error flags -->
 * myField.$error = { minlength : true, required : true };
 * ```
 *
 * Then the `required` message will be displayed first. When required is false then the `minlength` message
 * will be displayed right after (since these messages are ordered this way in the template HTML code).
 * The prioritization of each message is determined by what order they're present in the DOM.
 * Therefore, instead of having custom JavaScript code determine the priority of what errors are
 * present before others, the presentation of the errors are handled within the template.
 *
 * By default, ngMessages will only display one error at a time. However, if you wish to display all
 * messages then the `ng-messages-multiple` attribute flag can be used on the element containing the
 * ngMessages directive to make this happen.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- attribute-style usage -->
 * <div ng-messages="myForm.myField.$error" ng-messages-multiple>...</div>
 *
 * <!-- element-style usage -->
 * <ng-messages for="myForm.myField.$error" multiple>...</ng-messages>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Reusing and Overriding Messages
 * In addition to prioritization, ngMessages also allows for including messages from a remote or an inline
 * template. This allows for generic collection of messages to be reused across multiple parts of an
 * application.
 *
 * ```html
 * <script type="text/ng-template" id="error-messages">
 *   <div ng-message="required">This field is required</div>
 *   <div ng-message="minlength">This field is too short</div>
 * </script>
 *
 * <div ng-messages="myForm.myField.$error" role="alert">
 *   <div ng-messages-include="error-messages"></div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * However, including generic messages may not be useful enough to match all input fields, therefore,
 * `ngMessages` provides the ability to override messages defined in the remote template by redefining
 * them within the directive container.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- a generic template of error messages known as "my-custom-messages" -->
 * <script type="text/ng-template" id="my-custom-messages">
 *   <div ng-message="required">This field is required</div>
 *   <div ng-message="minlength">This field is too short</div>
 * </script>
 *
 * <form name="myForm">
 *   <label>
 *     Email address
 *     <input type="email"
 *            id="email"
 *            name="myEmail"
 *            ng-model="email"
 *            minlength="5"
 *            required />
 *   </label>
 *   <!-- any ng-message elements that appear BEFORE the ng-messages-include will
 *        override the messages present in the ng-messages-include template -->
 *   <div ng-messages="myForm.myEmail.$error" role="alert">
 *     <!-- this required message has overridden the template message -->
 *     <div ng-message="required">You did not enter your email address</div>
 *
 *     <!-- this is a brand new message and will appear last in the prioritization -->
 *     <div ng-message="email">Your email address is invalid</div>
 *
 *     <!-- and here are the generic error messages -->
 *     <div ng-messages-include="my-custom-messages"></div>
 *   </div>
 * </form>
 * ```
 *
 * In the example HTML code above the message that is set on required will override the corresponding
 * required message defined within the remote template. Therefore, with particular input fields (such
 * email addresses, date fields, autocomplete inputs, etc...), specialized error messages can be applied
 * while more generic messages can be used to handle other, more general input errors.
 *
 * ## Dynamic Messaging
 * ngMessages also supports using expressions to dynamically change key values. Using arrays and
 * repeaters to list messages is also supported. This means that the code below will be able to
 * fully adapt itself and display the appropriate message when any of the expression data changes:
 *
 * ```html
 * <form name="myForm">
 *   <label>
 *     Email address
 *     <input type="email"
 *            name="myEmail"
 *            ng-model="email"
 *            minlength="5"
 *            required />
 *   </label>
 *   <div ng-messages="myForm.myEmail.$error" role="alert">
 *     <div ng-message="required">You did not enter your email address</div>
 *     <div ng-repeat="errorMessage in errorMessages">
 *       <!-- use ng-message-exp for a message whose key is given by an expression -->
 *       <div ng-message-exp="errorMessage.type">{{ errorMessage.text }}</div>
 *     </div>
 *   </div>
 * </form>
 * ```
 *
 * The `errorMessage.type` expression can be a string value or it can be an array so
 * that multiple errors can be associated with a single error message:
 *
 * ```html
 *   <label>
 *     Email address
 *     <input type="email"
 *            ng-model="data.email"
 *            name="myEmail"
 *            ng-minlength="5"
 *            ng-maxlength="100"
 *            required />
 *   </label>
 *   <div ng-messages="myForm.myEmail.$error" role="alert">
 *     <div ng-message-exp="'required'">You did not enter your email address</div>
 *     <div ng-message-exp="['minlength', 'maxlength']">
 *       Your email must be between 5 and 100 characters long
 *     </div>
 *   </div>
 * ```
 *
 * Feel free to use other structural directives such as ng-if and ng-switch to further control
 * what messages are active and when. Be careful, if you place ng-message on the same element
 * as these structural directives, Angular may not be able to determine if a message is active
 * or not. Therefore it is best to place the ng-message on a child element of the structural
 * directive.
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-messages="myForm.myEmail.$error" role="alert">
 *   <div ng-if="showRequiredError">
 *     <div ng-message="required">Please enter something</div>
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Animations
 * If the `ngAnimate` module is active within the application then the `ngMessages`, `ngMessage` and
 * `ngMessageExp` directives will trigger animations whenever any messages are added and removed from
 * the DOM by the `ngMessages` directive.
 *
 * Whenever the `ngMessages` directive contains one or more visible messages then the `.ng-active` CSS
 * class will be added to the element. The `.ng-inactive` CSS class will be applied when there are no
 * messages present. Therefore, CSS transitions and keyframes as well as JavaScript animations can
 * hook into the animations whenever these classes are added/removed.
 *
 * Let's say that our HTML code for our messages container looks like so:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-messages="myMessages" class="my-messages" role="alert">
 *   <div ng-message="alert" class="some-message">...</div>
 *   <div ng-message="fail" class="some-message">...</div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * Then the CSS animation code for the message container looks like so:
 *
 * ```css
 * .my-messages {
 *   transition:1s linear all;
 * }
 * .my-messages.ng-active {
 *   // messages are visible
 * }
 * .my-messages.ng-inactive {
 *   // messages are hidden
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Whenever an inner message is attached (becomes visible) or removed (becomes hidden) then the enter
 * and leave animation is triggered for each particular element bound to the `ngMessage` directive.
 *
 * Therefore, the CSS code for the inner messages looks like so:
 *
 * ```css
 * .some-message {
 *   transition:1s linear all;
 * }
 *
 * .some-message.ng-enter {}
 * .some-message.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {}
 *
 * .some-message.ng-leave {}
 * .some-message.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {}
 * ```

    * @ngdoc directive
    * @module ngMessages
    * @name ngMessages
    * @restrict AE
    *
    * @description
    * `ngMessages` is a directive that is designed to show and hide messages based on the state
    * of a key/value object that it listens on. The directive itself complements error message
    * reporting with the `ngModel` $error object (which stores a key/value state of validation errors).
    *
    * `ngMessages` manages the state of internal messages within its container element. The internal
    * messages use the `ngMessage` directive and will be inserted/removed from the page depending
    * on if they're present within the key/value object. By default, only one message will be displayed
    * at a time and this depends on the prioritization of the messages within the template. (This can
    * be changed by using the `ng-messages-multiple` or `multiple` attribute on the directive container.)
    *
    * A remote template can also be used to promote message reusability and messages can also be
    * overridden.
